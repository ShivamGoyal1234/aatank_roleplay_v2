-- Base
Config.Precision                    = 0.04  -- This determines the precision at which the system will attempt to detect a seat. If set too low, it may cause severe lag. If set too high, player placement may be slightly off (The default value is 0.04)
Config.MaxHeight                    = 0.20  -- This determines the maximum height a player can sit at. A higher value allows for higher seating positions (The default value is 0.20)
Config.Distance                     = 0.5   -- This determines the distance at which the system will search for a seat. If set too low, it may not accurately detect seats. If set too high, it may produce unexpected detections (The default value is 0.5)
Config.GroundDistance               = 0.8   -- This determines the distance at which the system will search for a seat on the ground. If set too low, it may not accurately detect seats. If set too high, it may produce unexpected detections (The default value is 0.8)
Config.StairsDistance               = 1.0   -- This determines the distance at which the system will search for stairs. (The default value is 1.0) ## DO NOT MODIFY THIS SINCE IT ISN'T BUGPROOF ##
Config.MaxRetryBeforeSeated         = 10    -- This determines how many attempts the system will make to detect a seat. A higher value means the player will wait longer before being seated, while a lower value reduces the likelihood of finding a seat (The default value is 10)
Config.DistanceCheckPed             = 0.6   -- This determines the distance at which the system need to check for the closest ped to avoid 2 players sitting inside each other (The default value is 0.6)
-- I would advise to not change anything in this category, I've still left those options if anyone really need to modify such things.

-- Detection
Config.DetectWorld                  = true  -- This value determines whether the system should detect seats in the world (The default value is true)
Config.DetectProps                  = true  -- This value determines whether the system should detect seats on props (The default value is true)
Config.DetectVehicles               = false -- This value determines whether the system should detect seats on vehicles (The default value is false)
-- I would advise to not change anything in this category, I've still left those options if anyone really need to modify such things. Be aware of DetectVehicles, it doesn't work for every vehicles, thats why it's false by default!

end

-- This function allows to set a custom height adjustment value
-- It can be used to fix animation positioning issues caused by certain clothing or character models (For example, high heels)
-- Do note than in certain situations, for example, sitting on the ground, the position of the player will get lifted back up as the game thinks the player is inside the ground (Related to IK)
function HeightAdjustment(player)
    return 0.0 -- GetPedDrawableVariation(player, 6) == 7 and -0.08
    -- The commented code above checks if the player's shoe model (component 6) is 7 (high heels).
    -- If true, it returns -0.08, otherwise 0.0 (no adjustment).

    -- To use this logic, you could uncomment and modify it like this:
    -- return GetPedDrawableVariation(player, 6) == 7 and -0.08 or 0.0
