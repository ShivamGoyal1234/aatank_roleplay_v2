    Welcome to the **inventory configuration**!

    This configuration file contains essential settings to customize and optimize your inventory system. Before you begin modifying the settings, please ensure you have reviewed each section of the documentation linked below, as it provides step-by-step instructions and in-depth explanations for each configurable option.

    Key settings within this file are designed for flexibility. You are encouraged to adjust and adapt these configurations to seamlessly integrate with your server's framework, creating a more personalized inventory experience for your players.

    Editable configurations are located primarily in the **client/custom/** and **server/custom/** directories, making adjustments straightforward and organized.

    Framework Detection and Configuration Guide for inventory

    This inventory system automatically detects whether you are using `qb-core`, `es_extended`, or `qbx_core`
    as your main framework, assigning it to `Config.Framework` accordingly. However, if you have renamed
    any of these resources, or use a modified framework setup, you may need to update this configuration manually.

    To set up manually:
        1. Remove the automatic detection code by clearing `Config.Framework`'s value.
        2. Replace it with the name of your custom framework setup.
        3. Update any relevant framework-specific functions within the script's client and server files.

    Warning:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è The automatic framework detection is set for standard setups. Avoid modifying this section
    unless you have a deep understanding of the framework structure, as incorrect modifications
    could disrupt functionality.

    Remember, for the inventory system to work seamlessly, make sure `qb-core`, `es_extended`,
    or `qbx_core` (or their equivalent files) are running at startup.

    Backward Compatibility Mode for inventory Migration

    The `Config.FetchOldInventory` setting is designed for users migrating data from an older version of inventory to the current system.

    - **Purpose:** When set to `true`, this option initiates a one-time data migration process, transferring all relevant inventory data from the old inventory to the updated version.
    - **Completion Alert:** Once the migration is successfully finished, a message saying `Backward compatibility has been completed` will display in your console.
    - **IMPORTANT:** After the migration is complete, immediately switch `Config.FetchOldInventory` back to `false`. Keeping it enabled after migration can result in potential errors, as the script is not intended to run with backward compatibility enabled long-term.
    - **Usage Warning:** Do not use or modify other settings in the script while `Config.FetchOldInventory` is active, as this is a one-time migration setting designed solely for data transfer.

    Ensure to read the documentation for any additional guidance on migration steps.
]]

Config.FetchOldInventory = false -- Set to `true` only once to start the migration process, then return to `false` immediately after.

Config.UseTarget = false         -- Set to true to enable targeting with either 'qb-target' or 'ox_target', or false to disable entirely.

    Debug Configuration:

    This section is primarily for development purposes, enabling debug mode allows you to view
    various logs and prints related to script actions, events, and errors. This is useful for
    identifying issues and fine-tuning the script during the development stage.

    NOTE: Enable these options only if you are actively developing or troubleshooting,
    as they may increase server load and provide detailed output that isn‚Äôt necessary
    for standard gameplay.

    Interval in milliseconds to save the player inventory to the database
    To solve dupe problems we are not using the old one's system (Save inventory when inventory is closed)
    The new system is detects when the inventory is updated and saves it to the database after a certain time.
    But you need to be careful and avoid frequent script restarts. Because it doesn't work when the script is restarted.

    you can use /save-inventories for save all inventories to the database (if you need to restart the script)
